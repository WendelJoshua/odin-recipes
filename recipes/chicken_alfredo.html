    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Olive Oil</li>
            <li>Chicken Breasts</li>
            <li>Chicken Broth</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Fettuccine</li>
            <li>Parmesan</li>
            <li>Heavy Cream</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First, we’re going to cook our chicken breasts before preparing our pasta. Grab a large skillet, and heat oil over medium-high heat. Add your chicken breasts, seasoning with salt and pepper. Cook, turning occasionally, until they are golden-brown and cooked through. This should take around 10 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Then add the broth, milk, and garlic to a pan, then season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Bring to a simmer, then add the fettuccine. You’re going to cook your fettuccine in the liquid here instead of boiling it separately—it might seem crazy, but it will add more flavor to the noodles, and will save you from dirtying up another dish.</li>
            <li>Cook until barely al dente, then stir in the Parmesan and cream. Bring the mixture to a simmer and cook, stirring frequently, until the sauce has thickened and the pasta is al dente.</li>
            <li>Once done, remove from the heat and add the chicken.</li>
            <li>Then, garnish with fresh parsley if you so desire.</li>
            
        </ol>
