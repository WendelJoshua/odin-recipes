    <h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
    <p>Classic béchamel sauce is made with butter, flour and milk. For this pasta, I add little cream and little cheese to make it extra creamy, so you can say that this sauce is kind of a mix between alfredo and béchamel. But you can totally skip the cream and cheese and stick with milk only to make the classic version.

A bowl of this pasta on a cold day, it doesn’t get more comforting than this!</p>

    <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Boil 150 grams of pasta according to instructions on the package. I used regular penne pasta which was supposed to be boiled for 9 to 11 minutes. and drain. Make sure you don’t overcook your pasta, you want it al-dente. Note: use only 1 cup pasta if you like more sauce in your pasta. While the pasta is boiling chop all the veggies.
            </li>
            <li>Once the pasta is boiled, drain it using a colander and set aside.</li>
            <li> Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a pan on medium heat. Add all the veggies –

1 small red onion, chopped
1 medium red pepper, sliced
3/4 cup small broccoli florets
1/2 cup sweet corn (frozen corn which I added to hot water for 5 minutes before using).</li>
            <li>Cook the veggies for 2 minutes. They should remain crunchy. You can use other veggies like carrots, peas as well.</li>
            <li>Once done, remove veggies onto a plate.</li>
            <li> To another pan or you can use the same pan, now add 1 tablespoon olive oil and the remaining tablespoon of butter.

</li>
            <li> Once the butter melts, add the 5-6 chopped garlic cloves and cook for 1 minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Then add in 1 & 1/2 tablespoons of flour.</li>
            <li>Whisk the flour continuously, using a wire whisk for around 30 to 60 seconds. You don’t have to brown the flour much.</li>
            <li>Then add in 2 cups of milk. You can also add 1/4 cup heavy cream here or use additional 1/4 cup milk.</li>
            <li>Mix everything using a whisk so that there are no lumps formed.</li>
            <li>Add in the seasonings:

1 teaspoon Italian seasonings
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1/2 teaspoon red chili flakes (to taste)
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ol>
